# Welcome to my first Blog

I'm following the official Rails guide: [`https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

## Dependencies

The Ruby version used is `2.6.0` and the Rails version is `5.2.3`. Of course both are required for this Repository.

## Launch local server

First of all you would need to clone or download the GitHub Repository. To install all gem just run `bundle install`. You may need to firstly install Xcode if you are using MacOS X, which is available on the Mac App Store.

Then you should be able to run the local server with `rails server`.
